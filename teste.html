<p>
    After a pull request has been open for over 30 days with no activity or response from the author, it'll be automatically marked as stale. We might fork your changes and merge the changes ourselves. Since GitHub tracks contributions by commits, you will be credited.

<h2 id="build-yourself">Go build yourself</h2>
<p>
    Feel free to follow those steps when you want to build the font
    by yourself.
</p>
<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
<p>Install gulp (and gulp plugins)</p>

```bash
npm install
```

<h5>Build the font and export stylesheet</h5>
Open <a href="https://icomoon.io/app/#/select">icomoon.io</a> and import <a href="/icomoon.json">icomoon.json</a>. Choose <i>yes</i> when being asked
if you would like to restore the settings stored in the configuration file.

The next step is to click on <b>Generate font</b> and download the resulting archive. Extract the contents and you will find a <a href="/fonts">fonts</a> directory next to a <code>style.css</code>. Replace the contents of the <code>fonts</code> folder, rename <code>style.css</code> as <a href="/devicon.css">devicon.css</a> and follow the next step to build the final stylesheet.

<h5>Build and minify stylesheet</h5>
<p>
    Run the following command to build the resulting file <code>devicon.min.css</code>
</p>

```bash
npm run build-css
```
